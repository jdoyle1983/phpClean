phpClean
========
PHP Based Object Oriented Pages

* Complete isolation of page design and code.
* Object state management through post-back life cycle.
* Event driven methods.
* View state for storage.
* Standard web controls.
* Extensible controls through sub classing.
* Standard Controls:
	* Button
	* CheckBox
	* DataResult (A Data Grid)
	* DropDownList
	* Hidden
	* Image
	* ImageButton
	* Label
	* ListView
	* Panel
	* RadioButton
	* TextBox
	* FileUpload
* Zero fuss installation, it is pure code, and can be used anywhere
  php is already working.
* The main drawback is the requirement for strict xml on the design
  pages.  (All html tags must be self terminating &lt;p/&gt;, or closed
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;).
