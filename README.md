Object oriented wrapper around PHP.

PHP is great, but it reminds me of the old ASP days.  Then .NET came along, with the concept
of code behind.  I always thought PHP should implement something like that, so I created this
library to do just that.

Currently there are only a few base objects defined, but it is completely extensible.

It handles object state management, object page rendering, and call back methods.

It's main draw back, it requires STRING XML formatting for the designer pages.

You can see an example of the library in use in the source tree.
